#' Conduct a phase 2/3 dose optimization trial for survival endpoint
#'
#' This function calculates the stage 2 z statistics according to preplanned target number of events at each analysis.
#' The function returns (1) Z statistics at Stage 2 based on prespecified target events for pooled stage 1 (selected dose) and stage 2 patients. (2) The function
#' also returns the weights for combination p value approach in the next step and the weights are sqrt of information fractions. 
#'
#' @param data Dataset produced by simu.p23trial() function
#' @param DCO1 Data cutoff for Stage 1
#' @param targetEvents2 Planned target number of events for Stage 2. Either targetEvents2 must be provided.
#' @param dose_selection_endpoint Endpoint for dose selection at Stage 1. "ORR" or "not ORR"
#' @param method Options include "Independent Incremental": z1 at dose selection and z2 is from dose selection to kth analysis at stage 2; 
#' "Disjoint Subjects": z1 is at kth analysis for stage 1 subjects; z2 is at the kth analysis for stage 2 subjects. z1 will be adjusted by multiplicity and closed testing procedure at each analysis.
#' "Mixture": Only consider disjoint subjects at first analysis in stage 2. Starting from the 2nd analysis, consider independent incremental methods. Only z1 at 1st analysis will be adjusted by multiplicity and closed testing procedure.
