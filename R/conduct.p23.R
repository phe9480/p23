#' Conduct a phase 2/3 dose optimization trial for survival endpoint
#'
#' This function calculates the stage 2 z statistics according to preplanned target number of events at each analysis.
#' The function returns (1) Z statistics at Stage 2 based on prespecified target events for pooled stage 1 (selected dose) and stage 2 patients. (2) The function
#' also returns the weights for combination p value approach in the next step and the weights are sqrt of information fractions. 
#'
#' @param data Dataset produced by simu.p23trial() function
#' @param targetEvents2 Planned target number of events for Stage 2. Either targetEvents2 must be provided. 
#' @param method "Independent Incremental", "Disjoint Subjects". Currently, only "Independent Incremental" method is implemented.
