\title{Calculate power for group sequential design by simulation}
\usage{
gsd.power.new(z, bd.z, p = NULL, bd.p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{Standard z test statistics. A matrix of dimensions (n_trials, n_analyses).}

\item{bd.z}{z value boundary}

\item{p}{p values (1-sided),i.e., p = 1-pnorm(z)}

\item{bd.p}{p value boundary}
}
\value{
Cumulative power by analysis
}
\description{
This functions calculates the cumulative power and overall power for a group sequential design by simulations.
}
\examples{
#Example (1): Stage 1: 4 arms; 3 dose levels; each arm 50 patients.
#Stage 2: additional 200 patients per arm will be enrolled at stage 2
#medians for the 4 arms: 9, 11, 13 and control = 8 months
#Enrollment: 12 months uniform in stage 1; 12 months uniform in stage 2
#Holding period: 4 months between stage 1 and 2
#Dose selection will be based on data cut at 16 months
#Stage 2 has 2 planned analyses at 300 and 380 events respectively.

#Using O'Brien Fleming boundary, the rejection boundaries are: 
bd.z = actualBounds(planned.events=c(300, 380), act.events=c(300, 380), sf=gsDesign::sfLDOF, alpha=0.025)$actual.z
