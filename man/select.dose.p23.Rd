\title{Select dose at Stage 1 in a phase 2/3 dose optimization trial for survival endpoint}
\usage{
select.dose.p23(data = NULL, DCO1 = 16, dose_selection_endpoint = "ORR")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataset produced by simu.p23trial() function.}

\item{DCO1}{Data cutoff date for stage 1 dose selection}

\item{dose_selection_endpoint}{Dose selection end point: "ORR" or "not ORR"}
}
\value{
\describe{
\item{z1}{Stage 1 z values for each dose}
\item{e1}{Stage 1 number of events for each dose}
\item{s}{Selected dose}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the z statistics (z1) of all arms in stage 1, and select the dose based on maximum z in stage 1.

#Example (1): Stage 1: 4 arms; 3 dose levels; each arm 50 patients.
#Stage 2: additional 200 patients per arm will be enrolled at stage 2

#Enrollment: 12 months uniform in stage 1; 12 months uniform in stage 2
#Holding period: 4 months between stage 1 and 2
#Dose selection will be based on data cut at 16 months
#Stage 2 has 2 planned analyses at 300 and 380 events respectively.
