\description{
This function simulates a trial that has multiple dose arms at Stage 1 and Stage 2. No adaptation yet.
The function returns a data frame including all dose arms in Stage 1 and Stage 2.
Features include: (1) Stage 1 and Stage 2 have separate enrollment curves;
(2) Allow enrollment gap between Stage 1 and Stage 2.

\examples{
#Example (1): Stage 1: 4 arms; 3 dose levels; each arm 50 patients.
#Stage 2: additional 200 patients per arm will be enrolled at stage 2
#medians for the 4 arms: 9, 11, 13 and control = 8 months
#Enrollment: 12 months uniform in stage 1; 12 months uniform in stage 2
#Holding period: 4 months between stage 1 and 2
#Dose selection will be based on data cut at 16 months
#Stage 2 has 2 planned analyses at 300 and 380 events respectively.

#Dose selection decision is based on ORR.
